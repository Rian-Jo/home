For a robotic hand, manipulating objects as human does is a quite difficult story and grasping or pinching objects should be preceded before manipulation. Those operations are based on interaction between robotic hand and arbitrary objects. It means how strongly a robotic hand grasps arbitrary object with stable and unbreaking motion when interactions occur. This paper attempts a grasping force control of a velocity controlled robotic hand using external Force/Torque (F/T) sensors. This control uses F/T sensor feedback and produces a command torque. Then, velocity-torque transformer converts a command torque into an input velocity to the robotic hand system. The algorithm is analyzed through an experiment that shows how a grasping force affects arbitrary objects and obtained competent results.},

Multi-contact manipulation is useful for object-environment interaction tasks because it can provide both powerful grasping of the object body and dexterous manipulation of the object end-effector. However, dealing with the internal link contact with the object is not trivial. In this paper, we propose Reactional Internal Contact Hypothesis that regards the internal contact force as a reaction force so that the desired finger force can be reduced. By taking a handwriting task as an example, optimal configuration search and grasping force computation problems are addressed based on this hypothesis and validated via dynamic simulation.},

	abstract  = {In this paper, a torque control method in task-space for redundant manipulators with friction is proposed. A previous simple control approach based on virtual spring damper hypothesis is used to generate human-like motions. The method is efficient in the system which is difficult to identify the exact dynamics, however, the controller has steady state errors. To eliminate the steady state error, the gravity and friction, which is the part of the system dynamics, are compensated. Although the gravity and friction are compensated, the error of the modelling remains in the system. Hence, to reduce the nonlinearity, unknown effects, and modelling errors of the system, a torque controller based on Time-Delay Control (TDC) that eliminates the friction and unknown effects, is used. The performance of the control method, in Cartesian space control, is experimented with the torque sensor based 3-joints robot manipulator.

Exact model parameters are not easy to be known in the practical robot system due to the uncertainty of the robot dynamics. Hence, the gravity force is presented by a combination of gravity regressor and robot dynamic parameters and is compensated by the estimation of uncertain robot dynamic parameters. Previous researches conducted estimation by using transpose of gravity regressor and full form of dynamic parameters which is not general form however this paper estimates the gravity force using the generalized gravity regressor which is regardless of the dimension and structure of the robot under the quasi-static state. Once the estimation is completed, the estimated value can be used to compute the gravitational force and control the robot. It is shown that the generalized decomposition of gravity regressor and estimation process.

Even though the behavior of the robot has been achieved by previous studies, there are few studies considering the contact forces between the robot and ball. In this paper, we propose balancing and tracking control of the ballbot, with unilateral constraints. Using an adequate task transformation matrix, the task space dynamics can be divided into the dynamics of the robot and the ball respectively. This decomposition has advantages to obtain the input torque through the ball task dynamics with constraint forces. Through the proposed formalism, the contact force can be computed from the ball task space dynamics with the quadratic programming(QP) with inequality constraints such as unilateral constraints and friction constraints. The obtained contact force is used in the robot task space dynamics to get control input. In addition, the balancing force is computed using CoM reflex as a reference. Hence, using the synthesized controller, the contact force based balancing and tracking control simulation is performed.},

	abstract  = {This paper addresses reactive generation of step time and location of biped robots for balance recovery against a severe push. Key idea is to reformulate the balance recovery problem into a tracking problem for "hybrid" inverted pendulum model of the biped, where taking a new step implicitly yields a discrete jump of the tracking error. This interpretation offers a Lyapunov-based approach to reactive step generation, which is possibly more intuitive and easier to analyze than large-scaled or nonlinear optimization-based approaches. With the continuous error dynamics for the divergent component of motion (DCM), our strategy for step generation is to decrease the "post-step" Lyapunov level for DCM error at each walking cycle, until it eventually becomes smaller than a threshold so that no more footstep needs to be adjusted. We show that implementation of this idea while obeying physical constraints can be done by employing a hybrid tracking controller (together with a reference model) as our reactive step generator, consisting of a simple DCM-based continuous controller and a small-sized quadratic programming-based discrete controller. The validity of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation results.},
